# Reporting Issues #

The InfoTabby AIML set is a growing project. We want to hear your suggestions, comments, complaints, and, of course, we want to hear about any errors in the code that you might find.

Using Mercurial and Google Code to maintain AIML sets is not easy to learn in a day (unless perhaps you are already a version-control guru).  If you do put in the time, however, you’ll be able to do things like clone your own repository of the infoTabby AIML, make modifications to it, then submit them back to me for inclusion in the “official” set.

An even simpler option is to put change suggestions into the [Issue Tracking](http://code.google.com/p/aiml-en-us-ovrp-infotabby/issues/list) system in this project. Follow the link or use the Issues tab above.
