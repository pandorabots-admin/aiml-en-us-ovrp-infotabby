## Free A.L.I.C.E. AIML Set ##

We have released an updated version of the free ALICE AIML set and made it available on Google Code: http://code.google.com/p/aiml-en-us-foundation-alice/. The release is called AIML-en-us-foundation-ALICE (a free AIML set, in the English Language as spoken in the United States, authored by the AI Foundation, and the bot name is ALICE). The AIML contains some significant changes and improvements:

•The AIML Safe Reductions have been included and released as open source free software. This is a generic set of 

&lt;srai&gt;

 reductions that are useful for any English language bot.

•The GAC-80K data collected by the late Chris McKinstry, translated into AIML, is now included. The AIML consist of about 54,000 questions and statements with truth values varying from Yes ("Is violet a color"?) to No ("Are fish mammals?") with all sorts of gradations of Maybe in between ("Is the sky blue? Sometimes.")

•Numerous duplicate categories have been removed (though some remain) or merged. The AIML being available on Google Code makes it much easier for anyone in the community to clone and make modifications and correct errors themselves. These can then be submitted back for inclusion in the main branch of ALICE AIML. We are working on some documentation for this process.

This release deprecates the ALICE AAA Set and the test project to host free AIML on wikidot.com. AIML-en-us-foundation is compatible with any AIML 1.0.1 compliant interpreter, and runs on Pandorabots.
