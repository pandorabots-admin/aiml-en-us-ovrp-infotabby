# infoTabby, the Public Library Chatbot #

infoTabby is an AIML based virtual agent designed for libraries. She was created to provided immediate information about the library and to answer light reference questions. infoTabby is an offspring of David Newyear's "[Emma the Catbot](http://emmathemplcatbot.blogspot.com/)." Emma helped patrons on the Mentor Public Library's website from 2009 until 2012, and won the [2011 Polaris Innovation in Technology John Iliff Award](http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/pla/awards/polaris/index.cfm). Libraries are welcome to participate in the development and improvement of this chatbot. Read below to find out how your library can become part of this project.


## Creating your own library bot ##

You can create your own library chatbot using Pandorabots and infoTabby. Pandorabots provides a chatbot hosting service for bots written in AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Langauge). AIML is similar to html; if you understand html, you will quickly learn AIML.

You can make this chatbot do as much or as little as you would like, from answering simple FAQs and enhancing site navigation to passing searches to your catalog and databases and displaying the results.


It's easy to get started, here are the instructions: [How to create your own library bot](CreatingYourLibraryBot.md).

You can find tutorials and other information to help you customize infoTabby and learn AIML on our [Resources Page](Resources.md).




Libraries are invited to develop and improve this technology by becoming an active participant. In order to do so, you'll need access to infoTabby's AIML repository on Google Code. You can do this by making a clone of infoTabby on your own computer, making your changes, then sending those changes back to the repository.

You will need Tortoise HG to create your clone of the library bot and to share your work.

The first step is: [Downloading and installing Tortoise Hg](MercurialRepository.md)

**If you have never used Mercurial and are unfamiliar with version control, we strongly recommend that you read [Hg Init: a Mercurial Tutorial by Joe Spolsky](http://hginit.com/), one of the best introductions and explanations of these topics.**

After installing Tortoise Hg, follow these directions to [Make your own infoTabby clone](Cloning.md).
