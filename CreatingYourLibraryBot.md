# Creating an Automated Reference Assistant with Pandorabots #

You can create a reference chatbot using Pandorabots and infoTabby. Pandorabots provides a chatbot hosting service for bots written in AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Langauge). By making small changes to Infotabby you can create a chatbot for your own library.


### Before you start, you’ll need a few things… ###

**1. A Pandorabots account** - You’ll need this to host your chatbot.  Pandorabots.com also has documentation and material to help you learn how to use AIML to customize your chatbot. Go to http://www.pandorabots.com and create a free account. When your library’s bot is ready to go live, you’ll probably want to move to the supported server, but a free account is fine to start with.

Visit this page: [Creating a Pandorabots Account and Creating a Bot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtVz-YXzbUw&feature=related)
to get information relating to getting started with Pandorabots and AIML.

Pandorabots also offers premium services with more resources dedicated to your project (the free server is shared by more than 100,000 users).  See http://bandore.pandorabots.com/subscription/build/html/ServiceComparison.html for a description of premium services offered.

**2. A Google account (optional)** - Once you have your Google account, go to [http://code.google.com/p/aiml-en-us-ovrp-infotabby/](http://code.google.com/p/aiml-en-us-ovrp-infotabby/) and add this project to your favorites.

**3. Mercurial (optional, especially at first)** -  Mercurial is a system that allows multiple developers to work on the same project, and then merge their work into a unified whole. You can learn more about Mercurial here.
